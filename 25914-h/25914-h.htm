<h2>Preface.<br />
<small>WHY THIS LITTLE BOOK.</small></h2>

<p>About ten years ago the idea of writing a
little cook book had its birth. We were in
Almora that summer. Almora is a station far
up in the Himalayas, a clean
little bazaar nestles at the
foot of enclosing mountains.
Dotting the deodar-covered
slopes of these mountains are
the picturesque bungalows of
the European residents, while
towering above and over all
are the glistening peaks of the
eternal snows.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/002.png" width="160" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>We love to think of this
particular summer, for Lilavate
Singh was with us. The
thought of her always brings
help and inspiration.</p>

<p>One day she prepared for
the crowd of us a tiffin of
delicious Hindustani food. That afternoon
while we were sitting under the shade and
fragrance of the deodar trees, we praised
the tiffin. Before we knew it we were planning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a cook book. It was to be a joint
affair of Hindustani and English dishes, and
Miss Singh was to be responsible for the Hindustani
part of it. Our enthusiasm grew. For
three or four days we talked of nothing else.
We experimented, we planned; we dreamed, we
wrote. But alas! other things soon thrust themselves
upon us, and our unfinished cook book
was pigeon-holed for years and years.</p>

<p>And it is not now what it would have been if
finished then.</p>

<p>Many of the recipes, however, are those that
Miss Singh gave us then. Some of them she
might not recognize, for they have become quite
Americanized, but they are hers nevertheless,
and I hope that you will not only try them and
enjoy them, but that they will help you to solve
some of the problems of living and giving which
are confronting us all these days.</p>

<p>I have told this story before, but it fits in
well here. A lady in India once had an ayah,
who from morning until night sang the same
sad song as she would wheel the baby in its
little go-cart up and down the mandal or driveway;
as she would energetically jump it up and
down; as she would lazily pat it to sleep, always
and ever she could be heard chanting plaintively,
"Ky a ke waste, Ky a ke waste, pet ke waste,
pet ke waste."</p>

<p>The lady's curiosity was aroused. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
words were simple enough, but they had no
sense: "For why? For why? For why? For
stomach! For stomach! For stomach!" wailed
the ayah.</p>

<p>Desiring to know what was for why, and
what was for stomach one day, the lady called
the ayah to her and sought the interpretation
thereof.</p>

<p>"This is the meaning, Oh mem sahiba," said
the ayah: "Why do we live? What is the meaning
of our existence? To fill our stomachs, to
fill our stomachs."</p>

<p>You may smile at this and feel sorry for the
poor benighted Hindu, who has such a low ideal
of the meaning of life, but after all we cannot
ignore the fact that we must eat, and that much
as we dislike to acknowledge it, we are compelled
to think a great deal about filling our
stomachs. This is especially true these days,
when prices have soared and soared and taken
along with them, far out of the reach of many
of us, certain articles of food which we heretofore
have always felt were quite necessary to us.</p>

<p>The missionary on furlough is naturally regarded
as a bureau of information regarding the
land where he has lived and worked. Many
are the questions asked. These questions are
inclusive of life and experience in general, but
in particular they are regarding the food.
"What do you eat there? Do you get meat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
there? What kind of vegetables grow there?
What about the fruit of India? Why don't missionaries
do their own cooking? Do the cooks
there cook well? Aren't you always glad to get
back to the food in America?" These and similar
questions are sure to be asked the missionary
and others who have lived in foreign countries.</p>

<p>Feeling sure that everybody wants to know
these very things about India, it might be well
just here to answer some of these questions.</p>

<p>In regard to the meat in India: The Hindus
are vegetarians, but the Mohammedans are
great meat eaters. So are the English. Meat
can be had almost every place. The kind of
meat differs much in locality. Chickens can be
obtained anywhere. The Indian cock is small
of head and long of leg, shrill of voice and bold
in spirit. The Indian hen is shy and wild, but
gives plenty of small, delicately-flavored eggs.
On the whole, aside from a few idiosyncrasies,
the Indian fowl is very satisfactory.</p>

<p>In large cities like Bombay, Calcutta, Lucknow,
Madras, etc., where there is a large English
population, any kind of meat may be obtained.
In other places only goat meat can be obtained.
This is especially true in many hill stations.
Even in small places, if there happens to be a
large Mohammedan population, good beef and
mutton can be obtained in the cold weather,
and in many larger places where there are few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Mohammedans no meat of any kind is to be
found excepting chicken, and one usually has
to raise them himself.</p>

<p>Meat is cheap in India. Indeed, in some
places beef can be bought for two cents a pound.
However, it is not so good as is the beef in
America. In the hot weather, as it has to be
eaten almost as soon as it is killed, it is tough
and tasteless.</p>

<p>Vegetables differ, too, according to the
locality. If Mrs. A, returned missionary from
India, pathetically states that year in and year
out she never gets <i>any</i> home vegetables, and
thereby causes everybody to pity her, and if
Mrs. B, returned missionary from India, boasts
that she gets plenty of home vegetables, even
better than she could get in America, and thereby
causes everybody to envy her, don't think that
either Mrs. A or Mrs. B have fibbed. Mrs. B
lives up north and Mrs. A lives south, and both
speak truthfully.</p>

<p>The same is true in regard to fruits. Certain
fruits, such as the citrus fruits, the unexcelled
mango, bananas, etc., are found all over India;
but in certain sections there are not only these,
but all the home fruits. This section is to the
north and northwest. Pears, apples, peaches,
plums&mdash;in fact, any fruit that can be grown any
place in the world can be grown successfully in
this favored section of India.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't missionary ladies do their own
cooking?"</p>

<p>The idea seems to be abroad that the reason
that missionaries in India do not do more
manual labor is because they have a certain
dignity that they must maintain; that they
would lose caste and influence should they do
menial work of any kind. This is quite a mistaken
idea. One of the things that a missionary
stands for is serving, serving by hands and
feet as well as by brain and spirit. The simple
reason is that missionaries are employed by the
missionary society to do other things. It isn't
a question of giving eight hours a day to mission
work, but it's a question of giving all the time.</p>

<p>But suppose she hadn't her hands so full of
mission work, even then she could not do her
own cooking.</p>

<p>Perhaps she might do some of it if she had
an up-to-date little kitchen, with linoleum on
the floor, if there were a sink and a gas range,
and all sorts of lovely pots and pans, but alas!
in India there is not even a kitchen. It is a
cook-house, and is quite detached from the rest
of the house. If she cooked there, the missionary
lady would have to keep running back
and forth in the hot sun or in the pouring rain
of the monsoon. There is no linoleum&mdash;only a
damp, uneven stone floor, and there is no sink&mdash;all
the work requiring water is done on the floor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
by a drain-pipe, and sometimes if the screen
gets broken over the mouth of the drain-pipe,
toads come hopping in, and sometimes even
cobras come squirming through. The Indian
cook-house is always dark and smoky. There
is no little gas range; just a primitive cooking
place made of bricks plastered together. This
contains a number of holes in which are inserted
grates. Charcoal fires are burning in these
little grates. Charcoal has to be fanned and
fanned with a black and grimy fan to get it
into the glowing stage. Of course a clean fan
would do as well, but one never sees a clean fan
in an Indian cook-house.</p>

<p>However, do not suppose for a minute that
the missionary lady has no responsibility regarding
the cooking. She has. She cooks with her
nerves and brains. She has to train up the cook
in the way he should go, and after he has gotten
into the way, she has to walk along by his side,
for she must be brains for him for ever and ever.
She has to see that he walks in paths of truth
and uprightness. She has to keep everything
under lock and key, and is apt to lose her keys
when she is in the biggest hurry. She is also
apt to lose her temper, and feels worse over this
than she does when she loses her keys. She has
to argue over prices; to fuss over the quality of
charcoal consumed. She has to keep her poise
when, after ordering something especially nice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
for dinner, the cook proudly passes around something
quite different and not at all nice. She
dare not even visit her own cook-house without
coughing and making a noise, for fear that she
will have a case of discipline on hands that may
leave her without a cook. Verily, she is not
deceived by the fact that when she enters the
cook-house the cook and half a dozen other
men who have been playing cards and smoking
are respectively standing around like little tin
soldiers. She <i>sees</i> the hooka or big water pipe
standing behind the door, and she <i>knows</i> that
the bearer has a deck of cards up his sleeves.
But even knowing this, all she can do is to
meekly transact her business with the cook and
go out without saying a word.</p>

<p>However, in spite of all this, the Indian cook
is a great comfort. He grows on one. It is
surprising how equal he is to emergencies and
what really fine things he can make with very
few conveniences and often a very stinted allowance
of material. There are very few of
them who do not take pride in their cooking,
and they are never happier than when there are
guests in the home and they are having a chance
to show off. Nor are they uncleanly, as is often
supposed, but they keep their kitchen in such
mild disorder that things really appear much
worse than they really are.</p>

<p>And now for the last question. Often and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
often we are asked, "Aren't you glad to get
back to the food in America?" My answer is,
"Rather," and it is to be spoken with a rising
inflection.</p>

<p>We love the American people, and we enjoy
the American food, but we think that when it
comes to making nice tasty somethings out of
almost nothing, America is not in it at all.
Nearly every nation in the world can do better.</p>

<p>I hope these recipes will help.</p>

<h1>The Khaki Kook Book.</h1>

<h2>I.<br />
<big>Curry.</big></h2>

<p>Many regard curry as one of the new things
in cookery. This is a mistake. Curry is an old,
old method of preparing meats and vegetables.
Nor is it an East Indian method exclusively.
In all Oriental and tropical countries foods are
highly seasoned, and although the spices may
differ, and although the methods of preparation
may not be the same, nevertheless, generally
speaking, the people of all Oriental countries
freely indulge in curried food.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/003.png" width="500" height="265" alt="MAKING CHUPATTIES" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>However, in India curry reaches its perfection.
The people of India since Vedic times have
eaten curry and always will. They eat it very,
very hot, and Europeans who live in India soon
find themselves falling into the habit of eating
very hot and spicy foods. Whether it is good
for one to eat as much hot stuff as one is expected
to eat in India is a disputed point. In moderation,
however, curry is not harmful, and is a
very satisfactory and appetizing way of preparing
scrappy and inexpensive meats. If carefully
prepared, everybody is sure to like it. Do not
introduce it, however, to your family as a
mustard-colored stew of curry powder, onions,
and cold meat served in the center of a platter
with a wall of gummy rice enclosing it. Most of
the family would hate it, and it would be difficult
to get them to the point of even tasting it
again. Curry, as usually made in India, is
not made with curry powder at all. Every
Indian cook-house is provided with a smooth
black stone about a foot and a half long and a
foot wide. There is also a small stone roller.
On this large stone, by means of the small stone,
daily are crushed or ground the spices used in
making curry. The usual ingredients are coriander
seeds and leaves, dried hot chilies or
peppers, caraway seeds, turmeric, onions, garlic,
green ginger, and black pepper grains. All
these are first crushed a little and then ground<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to a paste, with the addition from time to time
of a little water.</p>

<p>Now of course no American housewife
would want to squat on the floor and grind up
curry stuff on a stone, as do the women of India.
So I hasten to say that very good curry may be
made from curry powder. Curry powder may
be obtained from almost any grocer. The
best in the market is Cross &amp; Blackwell's.</p>

<p>A good plan, however, would be to make
your own curry powder. It is better, much
cheaper, and is very little trouble to make.</p>

<p>The following formula is excellent:</p>

<h3><a name="Curry_Powder" id="Curry_Powder"></a>1. Curry Powder.</h3>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td3">10</td><td class="td4">ounces of coriander seed;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="td3">1</td><td class="td4">teaspoon of caraway seed;</td></tr>

<p>The coriander and turmeric may have to be
purchased at a drug store. Buy as many of the
spices ground as you can, and grind the others
in a small hand-mill or coffee-mill. Sift together
three or four times and dry thoroughly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in an expiring oven. Put in air-tight bottles.
A pound of meat will require about two teaspoons
of this mixture. If not hot enough add
more red pepper.</p>

<p><i>Coriander.</i>&mdash;You will note that coriander is
the chief ingredient of curry powder. Coriander
is used extensively in flavoring throughout the
East. It can be grown any place, however.
The seed can be obtained from any large florist.
It grows rank like a weed. The leaves are
delicious as a flavoring for meats and vegetables.
A patch of this in your vegetable garden will
repay you, as many a bit of left-over can be
made very tasty by using a little of the finely
minced leaf. The seeds are useful in many ways.</p>

<p><i>Fresh Cocoanut</i> is another ingredient frequently
used in making curries. This gives a
delicious flavor and also adds greatly to the
nutritive value. A cocoanut paste is prepared
by a very elaborate process in the Indian cook-house,
but in this country we are not only confronted
by the problem of living on our so many
dollars a month, but also by the equally great
one of living on twenty-four hours a day. So
we will pass the method of preparing cocoanut
by with the suggestion that you buy your prepared
cocoanut. Baker puts up an excellent
preparation of fresh cocoanut with the milk.
This comes in small tins at ten cents a tin.</p>

<p>Making curry is a very elastic method.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Much depends upon the taste of the individual.
Some think a teaspoonful of prepared mustard
or Worcestershire sauce a great improvement.</p>

<p><i>Always get cheap cuts of meat for curry.</i>
The hock or heel of beef makes perhaps as fine
curry as any other cut.</p>

<p>There are many different kinds of curries.
Some are so hot that the consumer thereof may
feel that he is the possessor of an internal fiery
furnace. Some are mustard-colored, some are
almost black, some are thin and watery, some
are thick, some are greasy, and some would be
quite impossible for America.</p>

<p>Onions are always used in making curry,
but do not let this discourage any one who does
not like onions. One reason that onions are
so unpopular is that so often they are improperly
cooked. In making curry onions
should be cooked until they are perfectly soft.
Indeed they should be reduced to a pulp. This
pulp helps thicken the curry gravy, and many
people who claim that they cannot eat onions
really enjoy them without realizing what they
are eating.</p>

<p>The recipes which follow are all practical,
inexpensive, delicious, and thoroughly reliable.</p>

<h3>2. Beef Curry.</h3>

<p>Cut a pound of fresh beef into bits. Any
cheap cut does well for this. Slice an onion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
very thinly, and fry together in a dessert-spoonful
of fat of any kind, the meat, onion, and two
teaspoonfuls of curry powder. When they are
nicely browned add several cups of water and
simmer gently until the meat is very tender and
the onion has become a pulp, thereby thickening
the curry gravy. This requires long, slow cooking.
More water may be added from time to
time. If one has a fireless cooker, it should always
be used in curry making. Serve with rice
prepared according to taste. In India, curry
and rice are always served in separate dishes.
The rice is served first and the curry taken
out and put over it. Usually chutney (<a href="#Page_63">Chapter
VIII</a>) is eaten with curry and rice.</p>

<h3>3. Chicken Curry.</h3>

<p>Cut a chicken up any way you like and fry
it with one thinly-sliced onion and the curry
powder. The amount of curry powder will of
course depend on the size of the chicken. Fry
together until the chicken is nicely browned,
then add water and simmer until chicken is
tender. Remember always to reduce the gravy
by slow cooking until it is somewhat thickened
by the onion pulp. A couple of sliced tomatoes
fried with the chicken, onion, and curry powder
is much liked by some&mdash;not only in chicken
curry, but in all curries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h3>4. Curry With Curds.</h3>

<p>This curry is prepared a little differently.
Place in a deep dish one pound of beef or mutton
or any kind of meat. Cover with thick
curds of milk. These curds should not be too
sour. Also add a green mango pepper thinly
sliced, and if desired a clove of garlic, finely
minced. Let stand in the curds for a couple of
hours. In the meantime fry an onion and two
teaspoonfuls of curry powder together. When
nicely browned add the curd mixture. Cook
over a slow fire until meat is tender. Cold sliced
meat is very good prepared this way. In this
case cook the onions thoroughly before adding
the curd mixture. The meat should be cut in
small pieces.</p>

<h3>5. Meat Curry with Pastry.</h3>

<p>Prepare the curry as in No. <a href="#Curry_Powder">1</a>, adding the
dumplings after the meat is tender. For the
dumplings, mix half a cup of flour into a stiff
dough with water. Add a little salt, and roll
out very thin. Cut in two-inch squares. Some
like a little fresh cocoanut and cocoanut milk
added to this curry.</p>

<h3>6. Meat Curry with Cabbage.</h3>

<p>Half a pound of meat is plenty for this very
hearty and inexpensive dish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Fry the onion, curry powder, and meat together
in the usual way. When nicely browned,
add several cups of thinly-shredded or sliced
cabbage. Cover with water and simmer slowly
until all are tender. Just before serving acidulate.
In India, tamarind juice is always used
for this purpose, but lemon or lime does very
nicely. Carrots or turnips may be used the
same way and are excellent. Eat with or without
rice. Usually this curry is eaten with
chupatties (No. <a href="#Chupatties_Americanized">69</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="Meat_and_Split_Pea_Curry" id="Meat_and_Split_Pea_Curry"></a>7. Meat and Split Pea Curry.</h3>

<p>Cut a half pound of beef or mutton into
small bits and fry as usual with onions and curry
powder. When nicely browned add a cup of
split peas which have been soaking for several
hours. Simmer all together in plenty of water
until the meat and peas are tender. Serve with
rice.</p>

<h3>8. Massala Fry.</h3>

<p>This is not really a curry, but is an excellent
way of preparing tough round steak.</p>

<p>Mix two teaspoonfuls of curry powder into
a half cup of flour, and pound by means of a
saucer into a pound of round steak. Fry the
steak with a sliced onion until quite brown.
Then add a little water and simmer until the
meat is tender. The gravy should be little and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
rich. Do not cut the meat. This is a fine
casserole dish.</p>

<h3><a name="Hamburg_Steak_Curry" id="Hamburg_Steak_Curry"></a>9. Hamburg Steak Curry.</h3>

<p>Fry together a pound of hamburg steak, a
cup of minced onions, and two teaspoonfuls of
curry powder. When these are quite brown
simmer with a little water until onions are soft.
This can either be served rather dry or with
plenty of gravy. In the latter case, serve with
rice or kidgeri (No. <a href="#Kidgeri">49</a>). A teaspoonful of
Worcestershire sauce is a help to this curry.
This curry is very nice and is quickly made.
Made dry, a little jar of it taken to a picnic or
on a trip will be found very useful, as it keeps
for days. Indeed, all curried meats keep longer
than meats prepared in other ways. Hamburg
steak curry makes fine sandwiches.</p>

<h3><a name="Cold_Meat_Curry" id="Cold_Meat_Curry"></a>10. Cold Meat Curry.</h3>

<p>Any kind of cold meat may be made into
curry. Fry onions and curry powder together
until nicely browned. Then add enough flour
to thicken, as in making gravy. Then add water
or cocoanut milk. When gravy has thickened,
add cold meat. Simmer slowly for a while.
This curry is not so tasty as those made from
fresh meat, and it is well to add a teaspoonful
of Worcestershire sauce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h3>11. Buffath, or Curry with Vegetables.</h3>

<p>Fry one-half pound of meat, finely diced,
with onion and curry powder. Add a little
water from time to time, so that the meat will
be tender and the onions soft. Then add two
teacupfuls of water. As soon as water boils
add a cupful of sliced radishes, potatoes, carrots,
or any vegetables that will not mash. Cook
slowly together until vegetables are soft. In
India this curry is always acidulated, but that
is not necessary. It is a good plan, however, to
always serve sliced lemon with all curries, as
some prefer them sour.</p>

<h3>12. Buffath of Cold Meat and Vegetables.</h3>

<p>Prepare a sauce or gravy, as in No. <a href="#Cold_Meat_Curry">10</a>. Add
cold meat and any left-over cold vegetable.
Simmer gently together for a little while. Do
not have too much sauce.</p>

<h3>13. Fish Curry.</h3>

<p>Fish curry is usually made with cocoanut
milk instead of water, but this is not necessary.
It should always be acidulated.</p>

<p>Prepare a sauce, as in No. <a href="#Cold_Meat_Curry">10</a>, using, if preferred,
cocoanut milk instead of water. Also
add a little finely-minced garlic and green
peppers. Put the raw fish in this and simmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
together until the fish is cooked. Serve with
rice. Spanish rice is excellent with fish curry.
(No. <a href="#Spanish_Rice">56</a>.)</p>

<h3>14. Curry from Tinned Salmon, Sardines, or Tuna.</h3>

<p>Prepare a sauce as in No. <a href="#Cold_Meat_Curry">10</a>, using cocoanut
milk and a little grated cocoanut. Also add a
tiny bit of thinly-sliced green ginger, garlic, and
chili pepper. Pour over the fish, and serve with
rice and sliced lemon.</p>

<h3>15. Salt Fish Curry.</h3>

<p>Cut the salt fish into rather small pieces, and
soak until no longer very salty.</p>

<p>While it is soaking, fry in plenty of oil or
crisco one bunch of green onions, cut up tops
and all, a teaspoonful of curry powder, and
three half-ripe tomatoes. The tomatoes may
be dipped in batter or crumbs. When these
are fried add the salt fish. Simmer together for
a while. Serve with rice. Eggplant is excellent
in this curry instead of tomatoes.</p>

<h3>16. Massala Fry of Fish.</h3>

<p>Make a paste of flour and water and two
teaspoons of curry powder and a little salt. Dip
the fish in this curried paste, and then dip again
in bread or cracker crumbs. Fry in the usual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
way. This is a delicious way of preparing any
kind of cutlets or chops. In fact, any kind of
meat may be fried in the same way.</p>

<h3><a name="Egg_Curry" id="Egg_Curry"></a>17. Egg Curry.</h3>

<p>Fry a sliced onion with a teaspoonful of
curry powder; then add a little flour for the
gravy. When this is mixed quite smooth, add
a teacup of water or milk or cocoanut milk.
Cook until it thickens, then add six hard-boiled
eggs. Cut in halves lengthwise. Serve with
rice.</p>

<h3>18. Poached Egg Curry.</h3>

<p>Prepare the curry as for No. <a href="#Egg_Curry">17</a>. When
gravy begins to simmer, poach the eggs in it.</p>

<h3>19. Eggplant Curry.</h3>

<p>Cut round slices of eggplant. Remove the
outer rind, dip each slice in batter and fry.</p>

<p>Make the curry sauce in the usual way.
When it thickens, carefully put in the eggplant;
simmer gently together until the vegetables are
well cooked. This is excellent made with half-ripe
tomatoes. In each case it is a fine meat
substitute. Always serve with rice.</p>

<h3>20. Curried Stuffed Eggplant.</h3>

<p>Make a curry mince as for No. <a href="#Hamburg_Steak_Curry">9</a>. See that
when the meat is cooked there is plenty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
liquid. Thicken this mince and gravy with
bread crumbs and let stand. Cut the eggplant
in half lengthwise, and steam or bake in a very
slow oven. When about half cooked, scoop out
the center of about each half. Be careful to
save the vegetable that you scoop out and mix
it with the curry and breadcrumb mixture.
Stuff the eggplant shell with this mixture, cover
the top with crumbs, and bake. Excellent
either hot or cold. A half pound of meat is
enough to nicely stuff one eggplant.</p>

<h3>21. Stuffed Curried Mango Peppers.</h3>

<p>To prepare the mango peppers for stuffing,
cut off the tops and remove the seeds. Let
stand in salt water until required. Then prepare
plenty of rice according to No. <a href="#Plain_Boiled_Rice">52</a>. Keep in a
warm place until required.</p>

<p>Fry Hamburg steak with onion and curry
powder according to No. <a href="#Hamburg_Steak_Curry">9</a>. A pound of steak
will be plenty for a nice big dish of peppers.
Use no water in this mince, but when the meat
and onions are partially fried add a cupful of
the boiled rice, and mix all together. Stuff the
peppers with this mixture of rice and meat.</p>

<p>Put in a roaster and cover with tomato
sauce. This sauce may be made from any
tinned tomato soup, diluted and more highly
seasoned, or it may be made from stewed
tomatoes from which the seeds and skins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
have been removed. Make sauce a little thick.
Bake very slowly or steam. Serve with the
remainder of the rice.</p>

<p>This is such a hearty dish that one needs
prepare nothing else to be served with it.</p>

<h3>22. Mixed Vegetable Curry.</h3>

<p>All vegetables such as peas, beans, potatoes,
carrots, etc., make excellent curry. They may
be either freshly prepared or left-overs.</p>

<p>Fry them all together with plenty of onions
in a little crisco; add as much curry powder as
is desired. If tomatoes are not used, acidulate
a combination of tomatoes, eggplant, and
peppers. Makes a fine curry. These vegetable
curries are usually eaten with chupatties (No. <a href="#Chupatties_Americanized">69</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="Split_Pea_Curry" id="Split_Pea_Curry"></a>23. Split Pea Curry.</h3>

<p>Soak the peas for two or three hours. Fry
in the usual way the onion and curry powder.
A teaspoonful of curry powder is enough for a
cupful of soaked peas. Mix the peas with the
fried mixture. Add plenty of water and cook
until the peas are soft enough to mash up into
a pulp. Serve with rice. An acid is desired
with this curry.</p>

<h3>24. Edible Leaves Curry.</h3>

<p>This may not sound especially inviting, but
in a pinch one might want to try it. The Hindus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
make curries from many things that we would
throw away. Turnip tops, beet tops, radish
tops, the young and tender leaves of many
jungle plants, also the leaves of many trees; all
these are used in making excellent curries.
Dandelion greens, spinach, Swiss chard, may all
be used in the same way. Prepare the onion
and curry powder in the usual way; then add
the greens. It is a good plan to add a few
potatoes to give body to the curry. Use very
little water in cooking. Serve with puris or
chupatties. (Nos. <a href="#Chupatties_Americanized">69</a>, <a href="#Potato_Puris">71</a>).</p>

<h2>II.<br />
<big>Savory Dishes from Other Countries.</big></h2>

<p>One of the economies in cooking is in the
proper seasoning of foods. This is the secret of
many an attractive dish made from left-overs,
or cheap meats. Every garden should contain a
little patch of mint, parsley, sage, coriander,
while those who have no garden could easily
grow these in window boxes or pots. It is not
an extravagance to have on hand plenty of
pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, kitchen
bouquet, and condiments of various kinds. A
little of these goes a long way in seasoning, and
many a dish which would be very flat and unattractive,
by their judicious use is made savory
and satisfying.</p>

<p>Garlic is also another seasoning which we
use but little, but which is used most extensively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
throughout the Orient. If properly used it gives
a delightful flavor to food. Very little is required.
Indeed, often one needs to just rub
the sides and bottom of the cooking vessel with
the garlic before putting it on the fire. The
salad dish may be treated the same way. However,
very few would object to a little finely-minced
garlic in almost any meat dish, and much
in flavor is often gained thereby.</p>

<p>Most of the recipes which follow are quite
new to Americans.</p>

<h3>25. Mulligatawney Soup.</h3>

<p>This is a very famous soup which has been
associated with India since the beginning of the
English regime. In India it is usually made
with chicken, but beef or mutton do very
nicely. Stew a pound of mutton. Scrappy
mutton, such as neck or ribs, does very nicely.
When meat is tender remove from soup.</p>

<p>Fry an onion with a teaspoonful of curry
powder. When nicely browned stir into it a
tablespoonful of peanut butter; also about a
half cup of fresh cocoanut. Mix these up together
to a smooth paste and add to the mutton
broth. Also pick the mutton from the bones
and add to the soup. If the peanut butter does
not thicken it sufficiently, thicken with a little
flour. Serve with rice. Sometimes the rice is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
boiled with the mutton, but usually it is boiled
separately (No. <a href="#Plain_Boiled_Rice">52</a>). Lemon juice is usually
served with this soup.</p>

<h3>26. Tamales (Mexican).</h3>

<p>Take a pound of meat. Mutton, chicken, or
beef may be used. It must be cut in bits. If
the meat has not sufficient fat, add crisco or
butter, or whatever one uses. Stew until meat
is very tender. Into this soup add a cup of
tomato sauce or a cup of boiled and strained
tomatoes highly seasoned. Then stir in enough
cornmeal to thicken it as for mush. Cook for a
few minutes and then turn all into a rice boiler
or steamer, and cook until the cornmeal loses
its raw taste. When a little cool, add a few
raisins, ripe olives, almonds, or peanuts, the
latter cut up fine. Make pretty hot with
cayenne, and also add a little pimento. Mold
into little rolls, and wrap each roll up in corn
husks, tying each end, so that the mixture will
not escape. Just before eating, steam up again,
and serve hot. If one is in a hurry, a dish can
be lined with corn husks, the mixture piled in,
and corn husks placed over the top of the dish.
This is called "tamale pie." If corn husks are
not available, it is very good without them.
The mixture can either be steamed in a bowl and
turned out or it can be sliced cold and fried like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mush. It is not necessary to add the raisins,
olives, and nuts unless one wants to be rather
luxurious.</p>

<p>At the table open up the rolls, remove the
husks, and eat with tomato sauce. A good
sauce for tamales is made by stewing tomatoes
with a little onion and green pepper, straining
and highly seasoning. Worcestershire sauce is
always good in tamale sauce.</p>

<p>This tamale mixture is fine for stuffing green
mango peppers. Indeed, it makes a fine forcemeat
for most anything.</p>

<h3>27. Koorma (Arabian).</h3>

<p>Koorma is usually made from mutton or
veal. Mince an onion, a little green ginger, and
a tiny bit of garlic and add to a cup of buttermilk.
Cover a pound of mutton with this and
allow to stand for a while. The mutton may
either be fresh or left-over. While the mixture
is standing, fry a minced onion; add to it a little
turmeric. Turn the buttermilk mixture into this.
If the meat is uncooked, also add a little water,
so that it may become tender; but this is unnecessary
if cold mutton is used. Simmer
slowly together until the meat gets tender and
the curds dry. At the last a little cocoanut
may be added, but this is not necessary. The
gravy must be very little and very rich.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h3>28. Spiced Beef.</h3>

<p>This is a very nice way of keeping beef if the
weather is hot and one has no ice. Cut the meat
up, salt a little, turn it into a bowl, and just
cover with vinegar. Sprinkle well with mixed
spices. When ready to use, fry with tomatoes
and onions. This may be kept for several days
without ice, even in the hottest weather.</p>

<h3><a name="Irish_Stew_Old_English" id="Irish_Stew_Old_English"></a>29. Irish Stew (Old English).</h3>

<p>Equal parts of meat and potatoes. Half a
pound of meat and half a pound of potatoes
makes quite a good-sized dish. Cook the meat
with a sliced onion in plenty of water until it
is almost tender. Then add the potatoes; also
a little mint or parsley, a tiny bit of green
ginger, and a sprinkle of cinnamon, salt and
plenty of pepper. Cook together until all are
sufficiently cooked. At the last, if mutton has
been used, add half a cup of milk. Thicken a
little if desired, only perhaps it is best to cook
it until potatoes begin to break, thickening it in
that way.</p>

<h3>30. Mesopotamia Stew.</h3>

<p>Equal parts of meat and string beans. Fry
together with or without an onion. When quite
brown but not hard, season well in any way
liked. In Mesopotamia, of course it is made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
very hot. Cover with water and cook slowly
until beans are soft and meat is tender. Less
meat may be used. Beans and meat should both
be cut up fine for this stew.</p>

<h3>31. French Stew.</h3>

<p>Take a pound of beef cut in small pieces
and fry it until brown. Remove and fry in the
same pan the following vegetables: Three small
radishes, three small carrots, three small onions,
half a dozen potatoes, a little green ginger, a
green chili or two, and three or four mint leaves.
The ginger, chili, and mint leaves should be
finely minced, but slice the other vegetables.
When the vegetables are nicely browned, remove,
make a little gravy in the pan; pour this
gravy over the meat, add the vegetables, and
cook very slowly together until the meat is
tender. If liked, it may be made with only
potatoes and onions and meat.</p>

<h3>32. Turkish Stew.</h3>

<p>Fry a pound of meat cut in small pieces.
Remove from the pan. In the same pan fry
eggplant, thinly sliced and rolled in batter and
crumbs. Season as desired. Put a layer of the
fried eggplant and a layer of the fried meat in
a cooking vessel. Add a little water, and cook
very slowly until meat is tender.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h3>33. All Blaze.</h3>

<p>This is an old English dish, and is fine for
the fireless cooker. Mutton is best for this
dish. One pound of mutton, cut in bits, one-half
pound of potatoes (quartered), peas, beans,
onions, carrots, or any vegetables one may have
on hand. Put a layer of potatoes at bottom of
the pan, then a layer of meat, then a layer of
mixed vegetables. Repeat this, sprinkling salt
and pepper over each layer and a little drippings.
Put in a vessel with a very tight-fitting
lid, so that no steam will escape, and steam or
bake slowly for three or four hours.</p>

<h3>34. Country Captain.</h3>

<p>This is another English dish, and is a great
favorite with the Indian cooks. Chicken is
always used in India, but veal or mutton will
do nicely. Cut up the meat, slice four or five
onions in rings, and set aside. Fry the chicken
quickly over a hot fire, then fry the onions.
With the onions fry some green chilies and a
little green ginger; add a cup or two of water
and stew until chicken is tender. Do not
thicken the gravy to this. Sprinkle fried onions
over the platter when it is ready to serve.</p>

<h3>35. Toad in Hole.</h3>

<p>Make a batter just as you would for pancakes.
Melt some butter or crisco in a baking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
dish and pour in half the batter. On this place
a mixture of meat, potatoes, and onions prepared
as for No. <a href="#Irish_Stew_Old_English">29</a>. Pour over this the remainder
of the batter and bake or steam.</p>

<h3>36. Minced Meat Patties.</h3>

<p>Prepare the mince according to No. <a href="#Hamburg_Steak_Curry">9</a>. Make
a piecrust, not too rich. Roll out paste, cut out
in circles about three inches in diameter. Put
in each of these circles a tablespoonful of the
curried mince, and turn over, pressing the edges
closely together. Fry or bake.</p>

<h3>37. Hamburg Cutlets.</h3>

<p>Take a pound of Hamburg steak, a minced
onion, a minced mango pepper, a leaf or two of
mint or coriander, a little salt and pepper, and
very few bread or cracker crumbs. Mix all together,
mold in little oblong cakes, dip in a
thin batter made of flour and water, and then
in crumbs. Fry in fat or oil.</p>

<h3>38. Potato Patties with Fish or Meat.</h3>

<p>Take equal parts of cold mashed potatoes
and flour. Work together into a paste and roll
out in circles about four inches in diameter.
Place in each of circles a spoonful of salmon or
tuna; season rather highly, press edges together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and fry. Fine way to use cold mashed potatoes.
Curried mincemeat may also be used for the
filling.</p>

<h3>39. Beef Olives.</h3>

<p>Have the butcher cut a very thin round
steak either of beef or veal. Cut this in pieces
about three inches square, and pound with a
saucer about a dessert-spoonful of flour into each
of these pieces. Make a highly-seasoned forcemeat
of breadcrumbs and onions and a little
minced bacon. Place a spoonful of the stuffing
on each square of meat, and roll in the form of a
sausage. Wrap each roll with cord and tie. Fry
the rolls, then remove and make a gravy in the
pan. When gravy is made, add the rolls and
stew gently until the rolls are tender.</p>

<h3>40. Bird Nests.</h3>

<p>Stew a pound of boiling meat with two sliced
onions until the meat is tender. Remove the
meat and onions, and when cold pass through
the meat grinder. Season rather highly, add
egg and breadcrumbs, and work all together as
though for cutlets. If flour is worked well into
it, no egg or crumbs will be required.</p>

<p>Boil six eggs until quite hard. When cold,
remove the shells. Enclose each egg in the meat
mixture. Roll in a thin batter, then in crumbs,
and fry. When nicely browned, cut with a sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
knife through the center of each egg. Place on
a platter, and pour over all a gravy made from
the broth in which the meat was boiled. This
makes twelve birds' nests.</p>

<p>A very attractive and delicious salad can
be made by using veal or chicken instead of
beef. The yolks of the eggs may be removed
and deviled or highly seasoned. Serve with
mayonnaise dressing instead of gravy.</p>

<h3>41. Eggplant Patties.</h3>

<p>Take two medium-sized eggplants, steam or
bake until tender; then cut lengthwise into
halves. Scoop out the pulp, cut the pulp in
small bits and set aside. Keep the skins for the
patties. Mince an onion, brown it in oil or
crisco. When nicely browned, add a quarter
of a pound of either cold or raw minced meat,
a little green mango pepper, and the pulp which
was removed from the eggplant. A little Worcestershire
sauce or piccalilli improves this
considerably. Fill the empty shells with this
mixture. Cover with crumbs and bake. Large
ripe cucumbers are good prepared the same way.
Only they should be peeled before steaming,
and the seeds should be carefully removed. If
a gravy could be made of stock and poured over
the patties it would be liked by many.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h3>42. Spanish Steak.</h3>

<p>Pound thoroughly by means of a saucer a
half cup of flour with a pound of round steak.
Then over a hot fire quickly fry the steak and
remove.</p>

<p>In the same pan fry two good-sized onions,
thinly sliced, and half a dozen good-sized
tomatoes and one large mango pepper. If the
pepper is mild, add cayenne pepper. When the
onions begin to get soft and the tomatoes to dry,
add the meat. Cook very slowly until meat is
tender.</p>

<p>One can use canned tomatoes very nicely
for this. Cook onions and tomatoes and peppers
together, with plenty of oil or crisco until they
begin to thicken. Then add the meat. This is
also a very satisfactory way of reserving cold
steak or any kind of cold meat. After the
tomato and onion mixture is well cooked, add
the cold meat and heat up all together.</p>

<h3>43. Spanish Welsh Rarebit.</h3>

<p>Fry in plenty of oil or butter or crisco a
large sliced onion. When onion is partly done,
add a tin of tomato soup or a cupful of stewed
strained tomatoes. Cook for a little while together,
then add half a pound of sharp cheese,
three or four pimentos, and a small tin of
mushrooms; also add a tablespoonful of Worcestershire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sauce. Cook all together slowly
for a while, then pour over toast or crackers.
This is also called "rinktum ditty."</p>

<h3>44. Kabobs.</h3>

<p>This is a very popular dish among the Mohammedans.
Kabobs are usually cooked by the
roadside and served piping hot to pedestrians.
They are also cooked on the platform of railway
stations and handed out to passengers on the
train. Season a pound of minced meat with
pepper and salt or any desired spices. Mix
with a little flour to hold together. Make in the
form of sausages by pressing around iron pins.
Roast over a hot fire. These are delicious cooked
at picnics. One can easily purchase the iron
pins or have them made. They are usually
about a foot long and a quarter of an inch thick.
If the meat is fat they easily slip from the pins;
if it is lean, it is best to grease the pins first.</p>

<h3>45. Char-chiz.</h3>

<p>Fry together a cup of Hamburg steak, a
cup of sliced tomatoes, a cup of minced onions,
and a cup of minced peppers. After they have
fried until dry, add a cup of water and simmer
all together for a while. Make quite hot and
serve with boiled rice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h3>46. Spanish Eggs.</h3>

<p>Fry the desired number of eggs very lightly
in bacon fat. Just before removing from the
pan pour over them a sauce made by adding a
tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce to any
good catsup. Heat hastily together and serve.
This is a fine meat substitute.</p>

<h2>III.<br />
<big>Split Peas or Dal.</big></h2>

<p>Split peas, or "dal," as they are called in
India, belong to the lentil family. There are
three kinds&mdash;the green, which very much resembles
an ordinary dried pea; the yellow, and the
red. In this country we only see two kinds&mdash;the
green and the yellow. The red are more frequently
seen in India, and have a more delicate
flavor.</p>

<p>Lentils are an old, old food. We read of
Esau selling his birthright for a mess of red
pottage, or a mess of red dal. Then later we
read of the Hebrew children refusing to eat the
king's meat, and growing rosy and fat on their
daily portion of lentils.</p>

<p>Lentils are rich in protein. About twenty-five
per cent of their food value is protein.
They are richer in protein than beans, and are
more digestible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>During Lent in the early days of the Roman
Church, lentils were the chief article of food,
because of meat being forbidden. Because of
this the name lentil was given to them.</p>

<p>Split peas are used universally throughout
India. Several recipes have already been given
(Nos. <a href="#Split_Pea_Curry">23</a> and <a href="#Meat_and_Split_Pea_Curry">7</a>), but a few others will be noted.</p>

<h3>47. Split Pea Soup.</h3>

<p>Soak a cup of peas over night and boil in
three cups of water. Cook until peas are soft,
then mash them quite smoothly. Then dilute
with stock. This stock may be made from bones
and cold meat or fresh meat. Fry an onion and
add to the soup, and when ready to serve add
minced mint leaves and little squares of toast,
fried very crisp.</p>

<h3>48. Dal Soup with Milk.</h3>

<p>Prepare the dal as above, except instead of
diluting with stock dilute with milk.</p>

<h3><a name="Kidgeri" id="Kidgeri"></a>49. Kidgeri.</h3>

<p>First soak a cup of split peas for about
three hours. Then put them on to stew with
two whole onions. When about half done add
a cup of rice. The water must be about two
inches above the split peas and rice. Cook until
rice and peas are soft and the water is absorbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Pour over all some melted butter or crisco.
Usually kidgeri is served with poached eggs.
Sometimes eggs are hard-boiled and sliced
over the kidgeri after it is dished.</p>

<h3>50. Armenian Kidgeri.</h3>

<p>Soak a cup of split peas for several hours,
then fry with two thinly-sliced onions and a cup
of rice. When slightly brown, cover with water
and boil. The water should be three inches
above the peas and rice; also add a little bag
of mixed spices. Fry some meat in a separate
pan. It may be either beefsteak, Hamburg, or
mutton. When rice and peas are soft, place a
layer of meat in a dish and cover with a layer
of the rice and peas. Repeat until all are used,
being careful to have the rice and peas on top.
Steam together and serve with cocoanut and
fried onions sprinkled over the top.</p>

<h3>51. Dal Bhat.</h3>

<p>Dal Bhat is the universal breakfast dish all
over India. Prepare as for split pea curry
(No. <a href="#Split_Pea_Curry">23</a>), but omit the curry powder, if desired.</p>

<p>Often it is prepared by frying minced meat
with the onions before the peas are added.</p>

<p>No food known gives as much real value for
the cost as do lentils. The green and yellow
ones can be obtained very easily at any large
grocery, and we urge all to give them a trial.</p>

<h2>IV.<br />
<big>Rice.</big></h2>

<img src="images/007-2.png" width="321" height="230" alt="POUNDING RICE" title="" />
</div>

<p>As a rule rice is badly cooked in the average
American home. For this reason last winter
when there was a good deal of talk of rice as a
substitute for potatoes, very
little enthusiasm was felt on the
subject, and indeed when one
thinks of the tasteless, gummy
mess which is so often put before
the family, this lack of enthusiasm
is not strange. However,
rice properly prepared
proves quite
a formidable
rival of
the beloved
potato, and
there are
endless
ways of preparing
it if
one only
knows how.</p>

<p>In the first place, very few know how to
cook just plain boiled rice. Many know that
there is a way of preparing it so that when done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
it will be a fluffy mass of separate grains, but
they have no idea how to go about making it
look like this.</p>

<p>The process is very simple. Always use the
unpolished rice. Rice with a creamy tinge is
better than rice with a pearly white tinge, and
the long grain is better than the short.</p>

<h3><a name="Plain_Boiled_Rice" id="Plain_Boiled_Rice"></a>52. Plain Boiled Rice.</h3>

<p>For every cup of rice have about eight cups
of water. Do not add the rice until the water
is boiling briskly. Then throw in the rice, and
give it an occasional stir until the water begins
to boil again. After that it need not be stirred.</p>

<p>Cook until a grain feels soft when rubbed
between the thumb and finger, then turn into
a colander. Drain off the water and pour over
the rice several cups of cold water. Drain that
off, too, and place the rice where it can have
moist heat for a while before serving. A good
plan is just to leave it in the colander and place
it over a pan of boiling water; or a steamer may
be used for keeping it warm, or a double-boiler.
By this method every grain is separate. Rice
served with curry is always prepared in this
way. It may be served in place of potatoes
with meat, and may also be used as a basis for
many inexpensive and attractive dishes, just as
macaroni and spaghetti are.</p>

<p>There is one objection, however, to rice prepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in this way. A good deal of the nutritive
value is lost down the sink-drain. In India this
is not the case, for every ounce of rice water is
there carefully saved. It is used in various
ways. Usually it is fed to the babies and
weaker children. Often it is given to ducks and
fowl to fatten them, and sometimes it is put
into the curry pot.</p>

<p>There is another method of preparing rice
which is almost as satisfactory, and by which
all the nutrition is retained. That is by cooking
it in a regular rice boiler. Put just enough water
over the rice to well cover it. After the water
in the lower vessel has boiled a while, if the rice
seems a little dry, add more water. Cook until
the rice is soft, then turn the fire very low, so
that the water in the lower vessel does not boil
but retains its heat. Let stand for a while before
serving, and the rice will be almost as
fluffy and white as though blanched by the cold
water process.</p>

<h3>53. Baby's Pesh-Pash.</h3>

<p>This is the first solid food that babies of
English or American parents in India are allowed.</p>

<p>Take about a quarter of a pound of lean
mutton and cook until it is perfectly soft.
Shred it finely and return to the broth. Cook a
tablespoonful of rice in this broth and shredded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
mutton. Cook slowly and let every grain swell
to its utmost. "Babies cry for it, and the doctors
pronounce it harmless." It is also very
good for the convalescent.</p>

<h3>54. Pullao.</h3>

<p>Pullao is the most festive dish in India. It
stands for all that roast turkey does in this
country. At weddings, feasts, and holidays it
is the chief dish. Among the Hindustani
Christians it is the Christmas dinner. Sometimes
it is served with rivers of hot curry flowing
over it, but often it is eaten without the
curry. In India it is usually made with
chicken, but any kind of meat does nicely.</p>

<p>For chicken pullao, take a good fat hen, not
too old, cut up and stew until almost tender.
Put a little bag of "mixed spices," such as are
used in making pickles, on to cook with the fowl.
While the fowl is cooking take about a pound
of rice and fry it with a few sliced onions and
a little butter or crisco. When the chicken is
nearly done, add the fried rice and onions to
the chicken and chicken broth. Put all in a
rice boiler if you have it and cook slowly until
the rice is done. Retain the spices. If rice
boiler is used there should be at least two inches
of broth above the mixture. If you have no
rice boiler, but must boil it on the stove, more
broth will be required. In the latter case do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
not cook until it becomes soggy. Cook until
the broth is absorbed, then steam.</p>

<p>While the rice is cooking fry a few more
onions with a handful of almonds and raisins.
When the pullao is ready to be served, pile on
a platter, then strew thickly over the pullao the
fried onions, almonds, and raisins. Last of all,
sprinkle generously with cocoanut.</p>

<h3>55. Beef or Mutton Pullao.</h3>

<p>Very delicious pullao may be made from the
cheapest cuts of beef and mutton. Get about
two pounds of beef or mutton, cut in bits. Cook
until it is very tender. Boil with this a little
bag of mixed spices and two onions. Unless
the meat has a good deal of fat, use crisco, or oil.
Two cups of rice will be the right amount to
use with two pounds of meat. Use the same
method that is used in making chicken pullao.
Fresh cocoanut is always delicious strewn over
pullao, and if curry is used with it, have cocoanut
in the curry.</p>

<h3><a name="Spanish_Rice" id="Spanish_Rice"></a>56. Spanish Rice.</h3>

<p>Fry 3 onions, 6 tomatoes, 2 peppers or pimentos
together. They must all be cut into
small bits. In another pan fry a cup of rice in a
very little oil or crisco. After the rice has
browned a little, add the two together, turn into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a rice boiler or steamer and cook until rice is
tender. A half cupful of grated or diced cheese
is an improvement to this dish. In case tomatoes
are not in season, a can of tomatoes, or,
better, a large-sized can of tomato soup will do
nicely. In that case fry the onions and peppers
and rice together. Then add the cheese and
tomatoes.</p>

<h3>57. Pea Pullao.</h3>

<p>Take two cups of cold boiled rice, add to it
two cups of freshly shelled peas. Pour over
the mixture a half cupful of milk or cream; add
a tablespoonful of butter or crisco, and cook in a
rice boiler or steamer until the peas are nicely
done. A few bay leaves and black pepper grains
are an improvement to this dish.</p>

<h3>58. Cocoanut Rice.</h3>

<p>Take a cup of rice, mix it into half a grated
cocoanut. A ten-cent tin of Baker's cocoanut
does very nicely if one doesn't care to prepare
the fresh cocoanut. Boil the rice and cocoanut
together, being sure to add to the water the
cocoanut milk. There should be about three
inches of liquid above the rice. Color the liquid
yellow with a little turmeric; add salt, six cloves,
two cardamon seeds, and twelve pepper berries.
Cook in a rice boiler or steamer until done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h3>59. Meat and Rice Hash.</h3>

<p>A very nice way of making hash is to use
rice instead of potatoes. Take cold meat and
gravy and stew together with onion. When the
onion is nearly done, add to the broth the rice.
A quarter as much uncooked rice as there is
meat is a good proportion. Cook all together
until rice is thoroughly done. Be sure and have
plenty of liquid to start with. This is much
better than meat and potato hash.</p>

<h3>60. Rice Cutlets.</h3>

<p>Left-over pullao or kidgeri or meat and rice
hash make fine cutlets. Mold, roll in crumbs,
and fry in the usual way.</p>

<h3>61. Fried Rice (Parsi).</h3>

<p class="center">(A fine dish for a missionary tea.)</p>

<p>Fry a cup of uncooked rice and a cup of
brown sugar in a tablespoonful of butter or
crisco. Cook until the sugar melts and begins
to bubble; then quickly add two cups of boiling
water. Simmer over a slow fire, or, better still,
in a rice boiler until rice is thoroughly cooked.
It can hardly be cooked too much. Remove
from the fire, pour over all a half ounce of rose
water and stir well. Press in plates and sprinkle
well with minced almonds, or any kind of nuts
will do. Also add a few cardamon seeds. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
cold, cut into squares and serve like fudge.
This is a very satisfactory little sweetmeat when
one wants a foreign dish. It is easily prepared
and very inexpensive.</p>

<h2>V.<br />
<big>Bujeas.</big></h2>

<p>Bujeas are always made from vegetables.
They are usually eaten with the native bread
instead of rice. Here again the everlasting
onion is in evidence,
for bujeas are always
fried with onions.
They are made from
any kind of vegetables
or green tops
of vegetables. Potato
bujea is one of
the most popular.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 234px;">
<img src="images/009.png" width="234" height="400" alt="AN INDIAN PRINCE" title="" />
</div>

<h3>62. Potato Bujea.</h3>

<p>To a pound of potatoes
take two medium
sized onions and
one green mango
pepper. If the pepper
cannot be had, use
the tops of onions and
a little cayenne. Fry
the onions, and when nicely browned add the
potatoes and peppers. If potatoes are medium-sized,
cut each potato in four pieces. Add four
tablespoonfuls of water and if hot food is liked,
a good sprinkle of cayenne. If more water is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
needed, add a couple of tablespoonfuls more.
Cook very slowly. Use plenty of oil or crisco
in frying the onions. This is good with old
potatoes, but is best with new ones. Tiny new
potatoes are fine cooked in this way. They do
not need to be scraped. Just washed thoroughly
and cooked whole.</p>

<h3>63. Banana Bujea.</h3>

<p>Take half a dozen not too ripe bananas, cut
them in pieces, and allow them to lie in weak
salt water for a while. Slice two green mango
peppers and half an inch of green ginger; also
cut in tiny bits a clove of garlic. Brown a
sliced onion in butter or crisco. Then add the
bananas, peppers, etc. When the fruit softens
stir in half a cup of cocoanut; any unsweetened
kind will do. Cook a few minutes longer.</p>

<h3>64. Summer Squash Bujea.</h3>

<p>First peel the summer squash. Then cut in
very thin slices. Fry an onion and sliced green
pepper together; then add the summer squash.
Add very little water. Simmer until done.</p>

<h3>65. Cabbage Bujea.</h3>

<p>Cabbage bujea is made just as other bujeas
are, excepting it is usually acidulated. Sometimes
fresh cocoanut is cooked with the cabbage
and sometimes a little shredded salt fish is
added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3>66. Radish Bujea.</h3>

<p>In India radishes are cooked just as other
vegetables, and radish bujea is very popular.
Peppers are not used in making this, but the
young tender leaves of the radish plant are used
instead. While the onion is frying, parboil the
leaves, drain them, and add them to the sliced
radishes and onions.</p>

<h3>67. Tomato Bujea.</h3>

<p>This is a fine bujea. One never cares for
meat when this is served. Fry a large sliced
onion and a mango pepper together until nicely
browned. Remove from the pan and fry in the
same pan six sliced not too ripe tomatoes.
These should be dipped in batter and then
breadcrumbs before frying. When tomatoes are
nicely browned add onions and peppers. Do
not add any water to this bujea. Heat very
slowly until well blended.</p>

<p>Eggplant, okra, pumpkin, string beans,
cauliflower, in fact most any vegetable may
be cooked in this way. One general rule will
suffice: Fry the onions first in plenty of crisco
or oil. If desired, fry also top of onions. Then
add prepared vegetables and a little water. In
most bujeas, peppers or pimentos are used.
Cook slowly. Vegetables like eggplant had
better be soaked in weak salt water before
cooking.</p>

</div>

<h2>VI.<br />
<big>Breads.</big></h2>

<p>Bujeas are always eaten with native bread.
For these breads the flour is always ground in
the home. The mill used is exceedingly primitive.
It consists of two large circular stones,
one fitting into the socket of the other. By revolving
the upper stone over the lower the grain
which is poured between the stones is crushed.
It is the women of India who do the grinding,
and "two women grinding at a mill" is a familiar
sight everywhere throughout the land.</p>

<p>The bread made from this home-made flour
differs very much from the bread we know. It is
not made into loaves, but into little flat cakes,
which are baked over coals on a griddle. No
yeast is used.</p>

<p>Although India is one of the greatest wheat
countries in all the world, the great majority of
people in India do not eat wheat bread. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
are too poor for that. They eat bread made
from the flour of coarser grains. Some of these
grains, such as millet and rye, we are familiar
with; others are quite unknown to us. Corn
and oats are but little used in India.</p>

<p>The bread made from these coarse grains is
hard to digest. It is made by simply mixing the
flour with water. The dough is then patted into
little cakes. The bread made from wheat, however,
is much finer, and Europeans living in
India soon grow to be very fond of it. Some of
the varieties would not be practical in this
country. However, a few forms of Hindustani
bread are quite easily managed here, and will
well be worth a trial.</p>

<h3><a name="Chupatties" id="Chupatties"></a>68. Chupatties.</h3>

<p>Take a pound of whole wheat and mix it
with water until a soft dough is formed. Knead
this well. Put a damp cloth over it, and let it
stand an hour or so. Then knead again. Make
out into balls, each ball about as big as a walnut.
Then roll each ball into a flat cake about as
big around as a saucer. Bake these cakes one
at a time over a very thick iron griddle that has
been well heated. Keep turning them over and
over while they are baking. Fold them up in a
napkin as they are baked and keep in a warm
place. The inside pan of a double boiler is a
good place for them. To be properly made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
these cakes should be patted into shape instead
of rolled, and the Hindustani women always
do it that way. These chupatties are eaten with
bujeas and curries.</p>

<h3><a name="Chupatties_Americanized" id="Chupatties_Americanized"></a>69. Chupatties (Americanized).</h3>

<p>Make a dough from a pound of whole wheat
flour, a half teaspoonful of baking powder, and
a little salt. Knead well and let stand. When
ready to bake them, divide into balls as big as
a walnut. Roll each out, spread a little oil or
crisco over it; fold up and roll again. Grease
an iron griddle and bake, turning from side to
side. These are not actually fried, but the crisco
in them and the greased griddle prevents them
from getting hard, as they are apt to do if made
according to No. <a href="#Chupatties">68</a>.</p>

<h3>70. Prahatas.</h3>

<p>This is a very rich and satisfying form of
native bread. Take a pound of whole wheat
and make a dough according to No. <a href="#Chupatties">68</a>. Divide
the dough into eight equal parts and make each
part into a ball. Flatten each ball a little and
spread with crisco. Double it up and repeat
this three or four times; then roll thin and fry.
Use as little grease in frying as is possible.</p>

<h3>Puris.</h3>

<p>Puris are similar in appearance to chupatties,
except they are fried instead of baked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="Potato_Puris" id="Potato_Puris"></a>71. Potato Puris.</h3>

<p>Equal parts of mashed potatoes and flour,
mixed to a paste and rolled very thin. Make
each puri about as large as a saucer. Fry as
you would fritters. These sound rather expensive,
and they do take a good deal of fat;
but they are to be eaten without butter. Eat
with curry. Nothing else will be needed at a
meal where these puris and curry are served, for
they are very satisfying.</p>

<h3>72. White Flour Puris.</h3>

<p>Knead for ten minutes a dough made from
a pound of fine white flour and water. Let
stand four or five hours. Divide into little
balls and roll until they are as thin as paper.
Fry as you would fritters.</p>

<h3>73. Sweet Potato Puris.</h3>

<p>Take equal parts of mashed sweet potatoes
and whole wheat. Work together into a soft
dough. Roll out into cakes, but not too thin.
Fry in as little grease as possible.</p>

</div><h3>74. Kausaundi Pickle (Americanized).</h3>

<p>This is a very sour pickle. In India it is
always made with sliced green mango, but in
this country very sour
green apples and lemons
do very nicely.</p>

<p>Slice thinly four lemons.
Sprinkle well with
salt. Cover with vinegar,
and let stand for
about a month.</p>

<p>Slice thinly four very
tart apples, two onions,
six large sour cucumber
pickles, and three large
red peppers. After
they are sliced mix intimately,
then add two
tablespoonfuls of ground
mustard seed, a little
salt, and, if the peppers
are mild, a little cayenne pepper; also add two
tablespoonfuls of thinly-sliced green ginger and
one tablespoonful of finely-minced garlic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Drain the salt and vinegar from the lemons
and add them to the rest of the mixture.</p>

<p>Roast two tablespoonfuls of turmeric until
the raw taste is taken away, then mix with it
two tablespoonfuls of ground mustard; add to
this a cup of salad and a cup of vinegar. Mix
well together and pour over the pickles.
If there is not enough oil and vinegar to cover
it, add equal parts of each until the pickle is
well covered.</p>

<p>This pickle is not to be cooked, but it is
best to let it stand in the sun for a number of
days. If there is no sun, the warming oven
would do. It keeps indefinitely, and is very
appetizing. It is fine for sandwiches. A little
in Spanish steak or curry adds much to the flavor.</p>

<h2>VIII.<br />
<big>Chutney.</big></h2>

<p>Chutney is a sort of a combination pickle
and preserve. It is usually made rather sweetly
and very hot, and is eaten with curry and rice.
It is, however, a fine relish with all kinds of
meats. In India it is usually made of the
sliced green mango; but of course we haven't
mangoes here, so we have to use what we can
get. Any tart fruit makes good chutney.</p>

<h3>75. Lemon Chutney.</h3>

<p>Cut a pound of lemons in twelve bits each,
and cook in vinegar and a very little salt until
the rinds are perfectly tender. Drain.</p>

<p>Dissolve a pound of sugar in a quart of
vinegar; put in the lemons and cook until the
mixture becomes thick like jam. Then add a
teaspoonful of cayenne pepper (or less), two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
tablespoonfuls of minced ginger, two tablespoonfuls
of mustard seed, and a pound of raisins.
Mix all together and boil ten minutes longer.</p>

<h3>76. Apple Chutney.</h3>

<p>Boil together three pounds of sliced apples,
two pounds of sugar, and a quart of strong
vinegar. When this begins to get like jam, add
half a pound of raisins, four teaspoonfuls of
finely-minced garlic, two tablespoonfuls of thinly-sliced
green ginger, one teaspoonful of red pepper,
and one ounce of mustard seed. Let simmer
a while, then bottle and expose to the sun.
Apricot chutney is delicious made the same way,
with the addition of several ounces of apricot
pits, blanched and minced.</p>

<h3>77. Rhubarb Chutney.</h3>

<p>Make just like apple chutney, only use less
vinegar. In addition to the raisins and other
ingredients, add a teacupful of finely-minced
and blanched almonds. This is worth trying.
Less red pepper might be used.</p>

<h3>78. Carrot Pickle.</h3>

<p>Cut the carrots any way that is desired. If
they are very small they need not be cut at all.
Sprinkle them well with salt and dry them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the sun for three days, being careful not to
forget to bring them in at night. For a pound of
carrots take a tablespoonful of mustard seed,
half a dozen peppers (sliced), two tablespoonfuls
of green ginger (sliced), and two garlics (finely-minced).
Cover with vinegar. These are excellent.</p>

<h3>79. Mixed Vegetable Pickle.</h3>

<p>Eggplant, radishes, onions, carrots, peppers,
all are largely used in making pickles in India.
They are chopped, sprinkled with salt, and dried
for several days in the hot sunshine. Mustard
seed, turmeric, and minced garlic are usually
added. After several days of sunning they are
bottled, covered with vinegar which has been
boiled, but which has been cooled.</p>

<h2>IX.<br />
<big>Most Everything.</big></h2>

<p>Many of the cooks in India make a very
simple puff paste.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 213px;">
<img src="images/013.png" width="213" height="400" alt="A FAKIR OF BOMBAY" title="" />
</div>

<h3><a name="Puff_Paste" id="Puff_Paste"></a>80. Puff Paste.</h3>

<p>Make a dough out of a pound of flour and
sufficient water. Knead for fifteen minutes.
Roll in a damp cloth
and set aside.</p>

<p>After an hour or so
knead again. Then add
a spoonful of shortening
at a time until the
dough begins to crack
and looks rough.</p>

<p>Roll out in a sheet,
cut in four pieces, place
one upon the other, roll
again, cut in four pieces
again. Repeat this four
times, then roll it into
a sheet, spread it with
shortening of some
kind, cut in four pieces,
and place one over the
other. Then roll for
the last time. The advantage of this method is
that it takes comparatively little shortening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and is always light and flaky. It makes a delicious
pastry for cheese cakes.</p>

<h3>81. Cheese Cakes.</h3>

<p>Place two cups of pure milk over the fire
and when the milk begins to boil squeeze the
juice of a lemon into it. The milk will at once
curdle. Drain off the curds. To these curds
add the yolks of two eggs, a tablespoonful of
butter, a small cup of sugar, and a small cup of
ground almonds. Walnuts, pecans, or any other
nuts would do all right.</p>

<p>Mix all together smoothly. Line little patty
pans with the paste (No. <a href="#Puff_Paste">80</a>), and fill with the
curds. Dust powdered sugar over the top and
decorate with crossbars of pastry. Bake very
slowly.</p>

<p>These cheese cakes are always much in
evidence at afternoon teas, garden parties, and
all social functions in India.</p>

<h3>82. Banana Stew with Cocoanut.</h3>

<p>Boil six bananas. To boil bananas do not
remove the skins. Just pour enough boiling
water over them to cover them. Add a little
salt to the water. As soon as the skins crack
they are done. Remove and cool. When cool,
take off the skins, scrape the bananas a little
and split them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Make a syrup of one cup of sugar and half
a cup of fresh cocoanut and half a cup of water.
Pour this over the boiled bananas and serve.
This dish is much appreciated by the children.</p>

<h3>Roselles.</h3>

<p>Roselles are a fruit belonging to the sorrel
family. The seed is sown in the vegetable garden
every year when other seeds are sown. The
plants have a vigorous growth. They grow as
tall or a little taller than currant bushes. Long
before the season is over the bushes are vivid
with wine-red flowers. From the waxen petals
of these flowers very delicious sauces, jams,
chutneys, and jellies are made.</p>

<p>Roselles can be grown any place as easily as
tomatoes or cabbage or any vegetable. It
would certainly pay any one to make the experiment.
The fruit is very rich in pectin, and
not only gives a beautiful color when combined
with any other fruit, but also adds much to the
flavor. Combined with peaches or strawberries,
cherries or guavas, or any other fruit that is
deficient in pectin, the roselle has very satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>When used by themselves a fine jelly is
made which is far superior to currant jelly. I
am sure any one will feel repaid who gives it a
trial. The seeds can be purchased from any
large dealer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h3>83. Roselle Jelly.</h3>

<p>Remove the petals of the flower from the
seed; then mince finely by running through the
meat grinder. To every cup of minced petals
add three cups of water. Boil quickly as the
color is much better if it does not stand around.
After boiling about five minutes it will be ready
to strain. Strain and make as any other jelly.
In flavor and appearance this jelly can not be
surpassed.</p>

<h3>84. Roselle Sauce.</h3>

<p>Remove petals from the seed, and for every
cup of petals take two cups of water. Stew
gently for a few minutes, then add a cup of
sugar for every cup of fruit. These two things
must be remembered if one wishes to get the
best results from the fruit. It must be well
diluted and it must be cooked quickly, as it is
apt to lose its bright color if it stands around.</p>

<h3>Tipparees.</h3>

<p>Tipparees, or cape gooseberries, are also
another fruit which is much neglected in this
country. To many they are familiarly known
as ground cherries. These are much prized in
India, and they really are a fine fruit, which can
be grown any place and will more than repay
the little time spent in their cultivation. In
India the seeds are sown annually. I think in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
this country it seeds itself for a few years at
least, but I am sure better results would be
brought about if the seeds were planted every
spring.</p>

<p>This berry is unequaled for making jam.
If any doubt it, buy ten cents' worth of seed
next spring, plant it in your garden. Let the
plants grow and spread and in the early fall
make jam according to the following:</p>

<h3>85. Tipparee Jam.</h3>

<p>Husk the fruit and prick each berry. Do
not add too much water, as the fruit is very
juicy. Cook until fruit is tender, but not broken.
For every cup of fruit allow a cup of sugar. Cook
rapidly and not too much at a time. It finishes
up very quickly. A good plan is to cook only
partially, turn onto platters, and expose to the
sun as one does any other sun preserve.</p>

<p>Tipparees are fine for making pies and tarts.</p>

<h3><a name="Orange_Marmalade" id="Orange_Marmalade"></a>86. Orange Marmalade.</h3>

<p>This marmalade can be made from oranges
or lemons or grapefruit, or by combining the
three, or by combining any two of them.</p>

<p>Either slice the fruit very thinly or run it
through a meat grinder. For every cup of
fruit take three cups of water. Let it stand for
twenty-four hours. Then boil it in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
water until the rinds are soft. Let stand another
twenty-four hours in the same water.
Then measure again and for every cup of mixture
take a cup of sugar. The best results are obtained
if not over four cupfuls are boiled at a
time. Boil rapidly. If citrus fruits are boiled
slowly they are apt to grow dark and strong.
If oranges are used alone for this marmalade
they must be sour. A good combination is four
oranges, two lemons, and half a grapefruit.</p>

<h3>87. Orange Jelly.</h3>

<p>Mince the oranges, rind and all. For every
cup of oranges take three of water. Let stand
in water for twenty-four hours. Boil until fruit
is soft and let stand again for another twenty-four
hours. Up to this point the process is
exactly like No. <a href="#Orange_Marmalade">86</a>.</p>

<p>Now drain the juice from the fruit. Acidulate
with lemon juice. If six oranges have
been used, add the juice of two lemons. To
each cup of juice take a cup of sugar. Boil
about four cupfuls at a time and boil quickly.
It will soon become jelly. A cup of roselle juice
diluted is better to acidulate with than the
lemon juice. A beautiful ruby jelly is the result.</p>

<h3>88. Candied Grapefruit Peel.</h3>

<p>Cut the grapefruit peel in sections. About
eight pieces to a grapefruit is a good size. Prick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
each piece and soak for three days. If the
weather is very hot, better scald the fruit instead
of soaking it. Change water every morning
and evening. On the morning of the fourth
day boil the skins until they can be easily
pierced. Remove them and squeeze them as dry
as possible. Place them on a tray and sun them
for several hours, or else dry them in an expiring
oven. Weigh the peels, and take once and
a half their weight in sugar. Make this sugar
with water into a thick syrup; then add the peels
and boil until they look clear. Take them out
and boil the syrup until it is quite thick. Return
the peels and stir around and around until the
sugar candies over them. Put them to dry in
the sun for a day. Orange and lemon peel, watermelon
rind, green muskmelons, and almost any
kind of fruit can be preserved in the same way.</p>

<h3>89. Banana Cheese.</h3>

<p>Take a dozen ripe bananas, skin them, and
mash them up with a cup of cream of wheat and
a cup of sugar; also add a tablespoonful of
butter and a little cinnamon. Cook slowly for
about three hours in a double boiler. When
cold cut as you would cheese. Fine for missionary
functions.</p>

<h3>90. Carrot Cheese.</h3>

<p>Boil a pound of carrots until very tender.
Then mash them perfectly smooth. Mix with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
them a pound of sugar, a tablespoonful of butter,
and the juice of a large lemon. Also add a few
cardamon seeds. Cook over a slow fire until the
mixture hardens into a paste. Add a little
more butter just before removing from the fire.
Press into shallow pans and cut in neat squares
or diamonds like fudge.</p>

<h3>91. Fruit Cheese.</h3>

<p>Any fruit may be made into a confection
which, in India, is called "cheese." The fruit
part first wants to be reduced to a pulp. Then
take equal parts of fruit pulp and sugar, with as
much butter as you feel you dare use. If you
feel that you dare not use any, use crisco with
salt. Cook down until it becomes a paste that
can be cut with a knife. It must cook very
slowly. Sometimes when nearly finished nuts
are added. In apricot cheese the kernels are
used. They must be blanched and minced.
Guava cheese is perhaps the finest, as the flavor
improves much with cooking.</p>

<h3>92. "Fools."</h3>

<p>A fool is a drink made of fruit pulp and milk.
Mango fool is perhaps the most popular. Fools
are always best made of tart unripe fruits.
Pare, slice, and stew the fruit until it is quite
soft. Strain through a fine sieve or coarse
muslin. Add to the pulp as much sugar as is
desired and enough water to make it pour easily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Boil for a few minutes and turn into a jug.
When ready to drink it, fill the glass about half
full of the fruit mixture and then fill with rich
milk. Add ice. These "fools" are very nutritious
and refreshing. Often in the hot weather
one cares for little else.</p>

<h3>Hindustani Sweets.</h3>

<p>Hindustani sweets are very sweet, very
sticky, very greasy, and very dear to the heart
of India's children, both old and young. We do
not advise a steady diet of these, but it is well
to know how some of them are made, as such
knowledge always comes in handy when arranging
for missionary programs, Oriental booths
in bazaars, and at frequent other times.</p>

<h3>93. Jellabies (Best Beloved).</h3>

<p>Make a batter of one pound of flour and
water. Make it just about as thick as you
would for pancakes. Cover the vessel tightly
and let stand for three days. Then stir in about
a half a cup of thick sour milk. Pour a little
of this batter into a vessel with a hole in the
bottom. In India a cup made from half a cocoanut
shell is made for this purpose, one of the
eyes in the monkey face at the end being perforated.
Fill this cup with batter and let the
batter run through a little at a time into a pan
of boiling fat. While the batter is running out
through the hole keep the hand moving in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
circle, so that the jellabies will take the form of
pretzels. Fry as you would doughnuts.</p>

<p>In the meantime have a dish of syrup ready.
Make this syrup from a pound of brown sugar
and water. Cook it until it is about as thick as
maple syrup. Keep this syrup in a warm place
and as the jellabies fry place each one for a few
minutes in the syrup. Remove and pile them
on oiled paper until needed. These are sure to
make a hit. Be sure and fry them until they
are quite brown. If one doesn't want to bother
with the batter standing around for three days,
they can be made up at once by adding a teaspoonful
of baking powder to the mixture and
beating it well. The milk must not be too sour
in that case.</p>

<h3><a name="Gulab_Jamans" id="Gulab_Jamans"></a>94. Gulab Jamans.</h3>

<p>Take a pound of rice flour. If one cannot
obtain rice flour use common flour. Put it in
a bowl. Crack into it two eggs, add a little
salt, and enough cocoanut and cocoanut milk
to make a soft dough. Use a ten-cent tin of
Baker's fresh cocoanut for this. Knead well
and cover for a little while with a damp cloth.
After a while mold this dough into little balls
about the size and shape of pecans. You will
have to keep your fingers oiled while doing this.
Fry them as you would doughnuts. Let stand
until perfectly cold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Weigh them, and for every pound take a
quarter of a pound of white sugar. Make this
sugar into a syrup. When thick put in the
gulab jamans and stir them for a few minutes.
When they are well frosted, remove. Spread
out on oiled paper. These are really very nice.
Any kind of little cakes and nuts can be frosted
the same way. The syrup should be allowed to
cool a little before the cakes are put in it.</p>

<h3>95. Malpuas.</h3>

<p>Make a batter of one pound of cream of
wheat and water. This batter should be very
thick. Let stand two days. Then add a cup of
grated cocoanut, a cup of small raisins, two eggs,
a cup of sugar, half a cup of curds, and a little
flour. Fry as you would pancakes. These are
to be eaten cold. These are also very nice to
serve at functions. If each one of these little
cakes is made the size of a dollar, a large number
could be prepared. A heavy aluminum griddle
is very nice for frying these, as they would then
require but little fat.</p>

<h3>96. Crow's Nest Fritters.</h3>

<p>Pare and cut in very small strips a pound of
sweet potatoes. Steam until a little soft, but
not entirely so. Make a batter of flour, two
eggs, and water. Put a tablespoonful of batter
on a well-greased griddle, then a tablespoonful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the potatoes. Cover these with another
tablespoonful of batter. When done on one
side, turn. Eat with melted brown sugar and
butter or with syrup.</p>

<h3>97. Hulwa.</h3>

<p>Fry a cupful of cream of wheat in half a
cup of butter or crisco. When it begins to have
a nutty flavor and to be slightly brown, add
three cups of water and one cup of sugar and a
few of the small inside seeds of the cardamon.
Boil slowly until it forms a thick rich paste.
Press into square cake pans and sprinkle over
the top minced nuts and also raisins, if desired.
Cut in squares like fudge. Very good and
wholesome.</p>

<h3><a name="Bombay_Hulwa" id="Bombay_Hulwa"></a>98. Bombay Hulwa.</h3>

<p>Bombay hulwa is noted all over India.
Soak a pound of cream of wheat in enough
water to cover it. Let it stand three or four
hours. Then rub it through a coarse strong
cloth until you get all the starch out. To do
this you must keep dipping the cloth in water
again and again. Let this water stand until
the starch has settled, then pour off the water.
Make two pounds of white sugar into a syrup.
Boil until it reaches the fondant stage, then add
the cream of wheat starch, and keep boiling
and stirring until it forms into a lump. Then
add about half a pound of butter. Crisco will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
do as well if salt is used with it. Go on cooking
the hulwa until it begins to get so hard that
you can hardly manage it. Then add a wineglass
of rose water, some blanched and shredded
almonds and the little inside seeds of half a
dozen cardamons. Delicious and nourishing,
but rather expensive.</p>

<h3>99. Turkish Delight.</h3>

<p>This popular confection is made by a similar
method to No. <a href="#Bombay_Hulwa">98</a>, excepting gum arabic is
used instead of cream of wheat starch. The
right proportion is about an ounce of powdered
gum arabic to two pounds of sugar. The butter
also is omitted at the last, but the almond, rose
water, and cardamon seed are usually added.
Press into plates, cut in squares, and roll each
square in powdered sugar.</p>

<p>There is an easier way, however, to make it.
Melt gum-drops. This is easily done by adding
a little water and boiling, or by keeping hot in a
double boiler or fireless cooker for a while.</p>

<p>Add the almonds and cardamons and lemon
or orange juice if desired. Dust powdered sugar
in a square pan. Press in the paste, dust powdered
sugar over the top. Cut in squares.</p>

<h3>100. Frosted Bananas.</h3>

<p>Use rather green bananas for this. Peel,
slice crosswise, sprinkle lightly with salt and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
fry. Be careful to keep them whole and not to
burn them. Allow them to get thoroughly cold,
then frost as directed for gulab jamans (No. <a href="#Gulab_Jamans">94</a>).</p>

<h3>101. Sujee Puffs.</h3>

<p>Make the paste according to No. <a href="#Puff_Paste">80</a>. To
make the mince heat a cupful of cream of wheat
in a little butter. Do not fry this brown, but
heat all through. Stir into this half a cup of
dessicated cocoanut, two tablespoonfuls of
small seedless raisins, two tablespoonfuls of
almonds (blanched and sliced), and the seed of
six cardamons. Cook this mixture for a few
minutes, then add a cup of sugar and cook for
a few minutes longer. This will not be a paste,
for no water has been added; so don't think it
is not right if it is very crumbly; that is the way
it ought to be. Roll the paste out not too thin,
cut in circles with a pound-baking-powder tin.
Put as much of the sweetmeat as you think you
can enclose, fold over, make as fancy as you
like, and either fry or bake.</p>

<p>This is a favorite sweet at native weddings.</p>

<h3>102. Breadcrumb Balls.</h3>

<p>Mix dry breadcrumbs and grated cocoanut
together, and a few raisins, too, if liked. Take
a cup of sugar and half a cup of water, and boil.
When syrup has reached the stage that it forms
a hard ball in water, pour over the breadcrumb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
mixture. Mold as if making popcorn balls. If
one likes, these may be rolled in powdered sugar
afterward. These are also a very fine sweet for
social and missionary functions of all kinds.</p>

<h3>103. Sujee Biscuits.</h3>

<p>One pound of cream of wheat and one pound
of sugar mixed intimately; then add half a cup
of lard or crisco and knead awhile. Form into
little balls and shape the balls as desired.
Usually they are simply flattened out into
squares. Bake a light brown. Be careful that
they are not crowded in the pan.</p>
